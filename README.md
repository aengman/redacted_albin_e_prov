Time elapsed: ~9:00h 

Minor difficulties: 
Early difficulties with setting up the app in the first place
BackgroundImage wasn't functioning as I wished
Padding caused issues with display: grid

Notable difficulties: 
Problem: "How do I get the arrowLinks to consistently align with the sideItems dynamically?"
Solution:  "They don't have to be the same size!"
Estimated time wasted: I thought of the solution while working on other things, no actual time wasted.

Problem: Button on the addForening page reloads the entire page
Solution:  Was a simple error with form buttons
Estimated time wasted: Unsure on the exact time, but likely around 10-20 minutes.
